  <h1>OpenGuitar</h1>
OpenGuitar is a project with focus on STEM education (science,
technology, engineering and math) for children and teenagers from
disadvantaged backgrounds. 


<h3>About Open Guitar</h3>
The ‘OpenGuitar’ is an experimental guitar that can be assembled in
small workshops. The instrument building process is designed as an
engaging and creative activity, which teaches a broad spectrum of
skills, from 3D design and hands-on woodworking to computer aided
manufacturing (CAM), sensor robotics and computer programming with a
focus on the elemental math behind digital signal processing.

<h3>How does the OpenGuitar work?</h3>
The core concept underlying the OpenGuitar is that, although it can
function as a normal piezo driven nylon-string guitar, to obtain the
best sound, it needs to be plugged into a computer. The OpenGuitar is
equipped with an electronic pickup system that allows the connection
with specialised computer software, which in turn enables a broad
spectrum of sound and music making capabilities. Consequently, while
children engage in musical explorations they learn basic skills in
computer programming through step-by-step music computing tutorials.

<p>We plan a workshop where educators and students build their own
instrument.</p>

<p>
<b>You can help us compensate for materials cost. 
We will provide a complete set of parts
to build-your-own open guitar for people donating over 500 Euros (in DAI).</b>
