## Alas Ramp 

This is a vuejs app that lets users pay crypto using Ramp.Network (using
Rinkeby testnet). Ramp is an easy way to buy crypto.

The app demonstrates a use case for OpenGuitar. Donors who want to help
the project can use Ramp integrated in the OpenGuitar webpage to send
money. 

OpenGuitar is a project with focus on STEM education (science,                                                                                     
technology, engineering and math) for children and teenagers from                                                                                  
disadvantaged backgrounds.  

We will conduct more workshops and we will soon be ready to send build-your-own open guitar kits to educators.
